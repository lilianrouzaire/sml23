# Statistical Machine Learning project

Hello,

This repo is dedicated to hosting files for my SML project.
Please find the report under Rouzaire_Lilian_final.pdf.
You will also find two Python files :
 - `project_mnist_utils.py` that contains utility functions (train loops, printing utils)
 -  `classifier.ipynb` that is a Jupyter notebook running the network, testing it, and displaying the figures.

The net visualisation graph was exported using torchview on a distant cloud machine because of local installation issues. Except this figure, all the other ones are reproducible using the code presented here.
